The party starts as slaves to a massive organization of Ogres who are looking to put the characters into a salt mine for the rest of their lives. As the guard has his back turned for a moment, the party catches a glimpse of a key ring around his belt. Could that unlock their shackles?
A merchant sold each party member a lemon item- a cracked hammer, tin-plated armor, etc. The party meets outside his shop, which is 'coincedentally' closed.
Someone dug a deep pit trap in the road, and a character (or someone else) has fallen in. The party gets together to help them out.
The party starts as gladiators and must fight each other. Either money or slavery led them to the colosseum.
The group are all on a caravan together travelling from one town to a nearby city. During the day, bandits/orcs raid the caravan, killing and burning some of the wagons before they take off into the wilderness. The group emerges from the ruins of their caravans and are forced into a makeshift group... do you search after the raiders for revenge? Get back items stolen? Or do you continue on your way because you have more important business/mission to attend to?
They are all framed for the same murder/robbery, and meet in jail.
The party all have ties to a specific Church. They may be members of the Clergy, Enforcers, or someone who has a negative tie to said Church.
The party is told about a new tavern that is offering free drinks for it's grand opening. They all attend and get Shanghaied. They wake up on a slave ship with no equipment and have to escape or take control of the ship.
