The morning sun filters through the trees as you step out onto your porch, the air carrying the scent of freshly baked bread from the diner downtown. Your neighbor waves as they pass, but you notice something odd—a second set of footprints trailing theirs on the dewy grass, though no one else is in sight.
As you browse the shelves of the little bookstore, you come across a journal tucked behind a row of novels. Its leather cover is worn, and the pages are filled with entries from someone in Maplebrook’s past—a life full of secrets and an ending that remains a mystery.
The antique shop on Elm Street has always been a place of quiet curiosity, but today, the shopkeeper pulls you aside. "This just came in," she says, handing you a tarnished locket. "I think it belongs to someone you know."
On your way home from the diner, you notice a new flyer on the community board. It reads, "Looking for answers? Meet me by the old oak at midnight." Curiosity tugs at you as you wonder who in Maplebrook would leave such an intriguing message.
A knock on the door interrupts your morning coffee. It's a stranger holding an envelope addressed to you, with no return address. "I was told you could help," they say, their eyes scanning the quiet street behind them.
While helping the bookstore owner organize a new shipment, you stumble upon a handwritten letter tucked inside one of the books. It’s addressed to someone in Maplebrook and speaks of a long-lost promise that was never fulfilled.
The annual Maplebrook Summer Festival is in full swing, and you’re manning the pie booth. As the day winds down, an elderly man you’ve never seen before asks if you’ve seen a woman named Eleanor, claiming she’s been waiting for him here since 1953.
While walking your dog through the park, you notice a child sitting alone on the swings, clutching a toy car. When you approach to ask if they’re lost, they look at you and say, "You’re not supposed to remember me yet."
The power goes out across Maplebrook one quiet evening, plunging the streets into darkness. As you light a candle, you hear a faint melody drifting through the air, coming from the direction of the old church that’s been closed for years.
At the edge of town, where the woods meet the river, you come across a small, weathered sign that simply reads, "Welcome back." You’re certain you’ve never been here before—so why does it feel so familiar?
The smell of fresh coffee greets you as you step into the diner for your usual breakfast. Today, the waitress hesitates before bringing your order and leans in to whisper, "Someone left this for you," sliding a folded napkin with a name you don’t recognize scribbled on it.
While mowing your lawn, you find an old metal box buried just beneath the surface. Inside is a collection of trinkets and a photo of a family you’ve never seen before, posing in front of your house.
On your way to the antique shop, you stop to pet the bookstore cat, Milo, lounging on the sidewalk. As you scratch his ears, you notice a small key attached to his collar, its purpose unknown.
The town's annual yard sale is in full swing, and as you sift through a neighbor’s table of odds and ends, you find an old scrapbook. Leafing through it, you see pictures of Maplebrook from decades ago, but some of the buildings don’t match what’s there today.
The school bell rings as kids spill out onto the sidewalk, and you wave at a group of familiar faces. One child lingers behind, staring at a large oak tree across the street, as if waiting for something—or someone—to appear.
As you walk through downtown, a handwritten flyer catches your eye. It reads: "Looking for someone to play chess at the park bench by the fountain. No experience required. Come at sunset."
You’re helping your elderly neighbor tidy their garden when they ask if you’ve heard anything about "the old wishing tree" downtown. They seem surprised when you say you haven’t, and mutter, "Not even a whisper? Strange."
You decide to join the local book club for the first time, meeting in the cozy bookstore after hours. The conversation turns to a strange chapter in the town’s history, and someone quietly suggests, "We don’t talk about that part of Maplebrook."
While picking up your mail, you notice an unfamiliar envelope in your mailbox. There’s no return address, just your name written in neat cursive handwriting. Inside, there’s a blank piece of paper—but it feels oddly heavy in your hand.
It’s a lazy Sunday afternoon, and you’re at the park, enjoying the sunshine. As you sit on the bench near the pond, an elderly man joins you, holding an old map of Maplebrook. "This town wasn’t always like this," he says. "Do you want to know what’s missing?"
