## Summary

In this final course project, you will pursue some combination of methods and approaches 
that we've used throughout the semester and/or elaborate your own in relation to the many 
ideas that our readings, discussions, and creative works have introduced. There are two (2) 
major parts to this assignment with a each comprising sub-parts which will allow you to share 
and reflect on your work iteratively throughout the process of creating it.

Please note the various dates below, as there are some interim due dates for progress reports
and bringing unfinished, in-progress work. These are important as they are chances for you to
show and discuss your ideas and approches. I trust and hope that these requirements are as generative
as they are evaluative.

## Goals

* develop a long-form work rooted in a single concept or cluster of closely-related concepts
* closely explore the opportunities and/or limitations of a generative method or approach
* reflect on the efficacy, value, and impact of the technologies involved and their implications for creativity
* relate your work to others that we have studied this semester in an effort to situate your efforts

## Baseline requirements

All projects must be approved prior to the start of the project development.

The generated work can be:

* text of _no fewer than_ 30,000 words and _no more than_ 49,999 words
* images of _no fewer than_ 30 images and _no more than_ 50 images (or combination of images and text)
* a system using LLMs for a specific application
* extension of an existing system that uses LLMs

The final product must be:

* related to one of the works we've read and/or prompting and/or project work we completed this semester
* if generating text/images, it must be in PDF or other non-Markdown form, with
  * a title page
  * a Table of Contents (if appropriate)
  * a list of references (if appropriate)

## Outcomes

* source code
* generated work

### Code

You are largely on your own for this project; I provide no "starter" here. This means you area free to innovate and
include tools we _haven't_ used to date or to bring tools in from other projects. The only rule is that:

* you must place your source code in the `src` directory

### Writing

There are three (3) writing assignments accompanying this project.

|Due Date |Description |Document |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------|
| 4:20pm November 15|Project Plan |[writing/plan.md](writing/plan.md) |
| 11am December 2 | Progress Report |[writing/progress.md](writing/progress.md) |
| December 6 | Presentations |  |
| 9am December 12 |Final submission | source code in `src/` and [writing/reflection.md](writing/reflection.md) |

### Workshops and schedule

This assignment honors our original routine of Wednesday prompting work and Friday formal feedback except that, unlike
previous weeks these are not optional (i.e. subject to the evaluation grid in the [Course Contract](https://github.com/CMPSC350-Computational-Narrative-F2024/course_information). There is at least one change, so to enumerate expectations:

* you will be given dates on which we will discuss your work (during Friday sessions)
* everyone _must_ respond to the work discussed during Friday sessions
* missing more than one (1) of these posts will constitute an incomplete final project
