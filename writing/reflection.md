## Final title

Textfall

## Summary

TODO: In no more than two (2) sentences, write a summary of what your work is "about."
Textfall is a text-based adventure RPG that utilizes generative AI to create unique experiences for each user.

## Reference works

TODO: Incorporate the three (3) reference works which can include the body of work we've read this 
semester with a meaningful discussion of how they relate to your final work. Here, use
passages from both _your_ work _and_ the selected work to make this comparison (or 
contrast!) clear.

## Describe your single largest success.

TODO: Describe
Creating a functioning game that allows users to customize their character and has multiple starting options.

## Describe your single largest challenge or failure.

TODO: Describe
Creating the ability to save and come back to the game or "opening" an image in the terminal.

## The role of feedback

TODO: Describe how the feedback from peers shaped your work. This can incorporate feedback
from earlier assignments or solely from this one. Cite at least two (2) examples, though
more are always more helpful.

## Contextualizing

TODO: This course asked you to understand language as technology and information for carrying,
permuting, combining, destroying, and altering ideas. How does your work fit into your understanding
of the course? If there's one final take-away from participating in creative diversion/adventure into
technology, narrative, and meaning, what is it and how did it factor into this longform work?
