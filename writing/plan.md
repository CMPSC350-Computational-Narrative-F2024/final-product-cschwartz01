# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary

I would like to go back to some of the earlier concepts we explored and create a text-based narrative game. Ideally, this game will allow users to determine what genre of story game they would like and then be able to create their own character/avatar to play with. This game will be choice-based and have unique narratives depending on all of the user's previous choices and interactions. Additionally, I would like to maybe include generated images to accompany the text, however this idea might change as I go own. I am hoping to use my experiences from prior projects in the making of this, using my learned knowledge of different prompt types and how they affect the outcome. I would like to engage with the learning outcomes of developing software to interact with LLMs and designing successful prompts to generate correct, relevant, and cohesive story lines.

## Peer works

Some similar works that use AI generation for text-based story games are [AI Dungeon](https://aidungeon.com) and [Saga: AI Text RPG](https://sagarpg.io). Both of these works use AI to create an immersive role playing experience for the user and uses AI to help bring a user's ideas to life.
Another project that is similar is [Text Adventures](https://textadventures.co.uk). Text Adventures is not AI-based in any way (unless someone specifically chooses to use AI in the making of their story) but it is all about text-based adventure games. The set up of this website includes a couple of different genres such as fantasy, comedy, or puzzle, which is similar to my current idea. I also intend to create categories for users to choose from when deciding on what game they want to play, potentially having each category be written in a different style.

## Challenges

One of the challenges I see that could be prohibitive is simply the amount of work. I think I need to focus on creating a good base before I start diving into different categories that users can play in. Additionally, I will need to create a chat history if I want the game to be unique and based off all of the previous choices a user has made. I think that I will have to be careful in how I do this so that I don't end up confusing the LLM and also so I can pull specific pieces of information out of the entire log history. I've never done anything like this before, so I think it'll just take me a bit to get the hang of it. I also think think that adding generated images could be a problem because the pictures can't display in the terminal which means I would have to change the game from being in-terminal only, so that will most likely just be an addition if I have the time so that I can focus more on the story part itself.
