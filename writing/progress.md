# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work.

TODO: Titles are the most fun

## Description

TODO: Provide a 3-5 sentence description of your progress to this point. What has been
difficult? What has been enjoyable? Has your concept changed or shifted in any meaningful way?
- for some reason sometimes the LLM would create the player's choice so I had to specify in the prompt to only follow what the variable `player_input` supplied

## Peer Feedback

TODO: Identify at least 3 questions to pose to an in-class peer. 

### Unstructured peer feedback

TODO: Dedicate this space to a summative comment from a peer. This may require you to share
this repository (briefly) with this person for them to replace this paragraph with the comment.

## Persisting challenges

TODO: Highlight challenges which continue to hamper progress.
